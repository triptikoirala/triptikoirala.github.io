   # Documentation:
    Below the sequence diagram in your markdown file, provide detailed explanations for each step:

## 1. Attacker sends attack instructions to BotNet:
      The attacker communicates with the compromised systems, instructing them to initiate a coordinated attack against the web server.
 
## 2. BotNet sends a flood of requests to WebServer:
      The bots start sending an overwhelming number of requests to the targeted web server, attempting to consume its resources.

## 3. WebServer alerts Firewall about High Traffic Volume:
      As the server begins to experience excessive traffic, it notifies the firewall, indicating that the traffic is unusual and potentially harmful.

## 4. Firewall analyzes traffic:
      The firewall assesses the incoming traffic to determine if it can distinguish between legitimate user requests and those generated by the bots.

## 5. Firewall blocks suspicious IPs:
      Based on its analysis, the firewall identifies and blocks the IP addresses associated with the botnet, attempting to mitigate the attack.

## 6. WebServer experiences Denial of Service for Legitimate Users:
      Despite the firewall's efforts, the server continues to struggle under the load of requests, causing delays or service unavailability for legitimate users.
## 7. Firewall drops traffic from bots:

      At the end, the firewall implements measures to drop the malicious traffic from the bots, hoping to restore normal service.
